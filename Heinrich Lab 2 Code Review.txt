Lab 2 Code Review
Brieana Hunter


First Impressions:
I like the layout of your GUI; it is easy on the eyes and simple for the user to navigate. I also like how you used message boxes to display information, such as population and average. I also like how nice and big the buttons are; it makes it easy for the users to see and read. Overall, I think the application's layout is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. 


Readability:
The code is very easy to read, not overly complicated, and easy to follow. I like how you coded this program; it is very simple, which I really like. Also, great job on including comments; I often forget to do so. The comments make it very easy to follow along with your code.


Software Error:
I did not notice any errors.


How Our Programs Differ:
Our programs are quite different, for example, to get the average of the row I did-
average = cityDBDataSet.City.Average(row => row.Population);
You did a getaveragepopulation method, which I think is a great way to do it, it is easier to understand.


Constrictive Criticism:
I don't have any criticism. I like the way you coded your program, and the layout was nice and easy to read.
