Lab 2 Code Review
By Shawn Conboy

First off, does the program run initially with no issues?

	Program runs initially. No issues upon normal usage.
	(just pressing given buttons).

	Sort Population button (alphabetical). First impression, 
	what exactly does this sort? I can see what is sorted 
	after pressing the button, but it's not clearly noted
	prior to pressing button. 

	Possibly reword text to say "Sort City (alphabetical)"

	I also added a record. That worked fine and updated the
	cityID after saving.

	I liked the formatting of the message boxes. Clean and 
	simple UI.


Is the code generally readable and well-documented?
	
	Yes. Code is readable and well documented. Methods have a
	start point. Methods have comments allowing reviewer to 
	understand clearly what method should be doing.

Did you find any software defects?
	
	No software defects were found. No errors or warning in
	debug console while running.

What was one way that your solution differed from yours?
	
	We have very similar solutions. Your message boxes to 
	show data to user are where our programs differed.
	I used labels to show data instead.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
	
	Nothing here that wasn't stated at the very beginning.
	Clean, solid lab. Will love to review your next.
